# Git Version Control

**Git** is a version control system (VCS), which is a fancy way of saying it's a tool that tracks changes to your code. Think of it like a super-powered "undo" button for your entire project, combined with the ability to see who changed what, and when. Itâ€™s the industry standard for collaborating on software.

-----

## Core Concepts

Understanding these ideas is key to using Git effectively.

  - **Repository (Repo):** This is your project folder. A Git repo contains all of your project files and the entire history of changes.
  - **Commit:** A snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique ID and a message describing the changes.
  - **Branch:** An independent line of development. You can create a new branch to work on a new feature without affecting the main codebase (usually called the `main` or `master` branch).
  - **Merge:** The process of combining the changes from one branch into another.
  - **Staging Area:** An intermediate step before committing. You add files to the staging area to tell Git exactly which changes you want to include in the next commit.
  - **Remote:** A version of your repository hosted on a server, like **GitHub** or **GitLab**. It's the central place where you and your team can share code.
  - **Push & Pull:** **Pushing** sends your committed changes to a remote repository. **Pulling** fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into your local copy.

## Common Git Commands

You'll be using these commands constantly in your terminal.

  - **`git init`**: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.
  - **`git clone <url>`**: Creates a local copy of a remote repository.
  - **`git status`**: Shows the current state of your repository (which files are modified, staged, etc.).
  - **`git add <file>`**: Adds a file's changes to the staging area. Use `git add .` to stage all changes.
  - **`git commit -m "Your message"`**: Saves the staged changes as a new commit with a descriptive message.
  - **`git log`**: Displays the commit history.
  - **`git branch <name>`**: Creates a new branch.
  - **`git checkout <branch>`**: Switches to a different branch.
  - **`git merge <branch>`**: Merges the specified branch into your current branch.
  - **`git pull`**: Fetches and merges changes from the remote repository.
  - **`git push`**: Pushes your committed changes to the remote repository.

### Setup Guide

1.  **Download and Install Git**

      - Go to [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
      - Download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
      - Run the installer, accepting the default options is usually fine.

2.  **Configure Your Identity**

      - Open a terminal (or Git Bash on Windows).
      - Tell Git who you are. This information is attached to every commit you make.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```bash
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
    ```

3.  **Check Your Configuration**

      - You can verify your settings with this command:

    <!-- end list -->

    ```bash
    git config --list
    ```

## Challenges

1.  **Install Git and configure your username and email.** (50 pts)

2.  **Create your first local repository.** (50 pts)

      - Create a new folder on your computer.
      - Initialize a Git repository inside it (`git init`).
      - Add a new file (e.g., `README.md`) with some text.
      - Stage the file (`git add`).
      - Make your first commit (`git commit`).

3.  **Push your repository to GitHub.** (30 pts)

      - Create a new, empty repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
      - Connect your local repository to the remote one on GitHub.
      - Push your local commit to GitHub.

-----

## **Tips for Challenge 3:**

### Linking a Local Repo to GitHub

1.  **Create a New Repository on GitHub:**

      - Log in to GitHub and click the "+" icon in the top-right, then select "New repository."
      - Give it a name, but **do not** initialize it with a README, .gitignore, or license file (since you already have a local repo).
      - Click "Create repository."

2.  **Get the Remote URL:**

      - On the next page, GitHub will show you the repository's URL. Copy the HTTPS or SSH URL. It will look something like `https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git`.

3.  **Link and Push from Your Terminal:**

      - In your terminal, navigate to your local project folder.
      - Run the following commands, replacing the URL with the one you copied.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```bash
    # Link your local repo to the remote GitHub repo
    git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

    # Rename your default branch to 'main' (a common standard)
    git branch -M main

    # Push your 'main' branch to the remote repo named 'origin'
    # The -u flag sets the upstream so you can use 'git push' by itself in the future
    git push -u origin main
    ```

4.  **Verify:**

      - Refresh your GitHub repository page. You should now see your `README.md` file and your first commit\!
