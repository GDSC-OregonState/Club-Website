# Winter Hackathon: Learn, Build, and Win Prizes!⭐

---

This term, we’re hosting a **term-long hackathon**, giving you the time to build a complete, polished project (without the stress of a weekend sprint). With classes, midterms, and other commitments, this format lets you learn new technologies at your own pace and create something you’re proud to show off.

You’ll spend the term developing a project that strengthens your **resume**, builds real experience, and prepares you for **BeaverHacks**, Oregon’s largest hackathon, in April (hosted with our Google Developer Group chapter).

## 🛠️ How it Works

- **Teams:** Form your own team or join one led by an officer for additional guidance

- **Team Size:** Up to 4 people

- **Build:** Work whenever you want up until submissions are due—we will have time during out normal weekly meetings where you can get guidance from officers if you have any questions about tech stack, design, or anything else

- **Showcase:** Present your project in Week 10 to be eligible for prizes

## 🎨 Theme: "Make Something Cool"

There's no strict category of platform that you have to use for your project, it can be a website, a mobile app, a unity game, or even a python automation tool.

**The Goal** of this hackathon is to create a project that is high-quality enough to stand out on your **resume**. We want to help you walk away with a project for your resume but also a project that you are proud of.

## 📜 The Rules

To keep things fair and organized, we have a few simple requirements:
 - **Max 4 people** per team.
 - **Git Repository:** You must have a Github repository with a clear commit history. We want to see the progress you made throughout the term!
 - **Week 10 Presentation (March 9th):** You must present your project during the Week 10 showcase to be eligible for prizes.
 - **Devpost:** All projects must be submitted to our Devpost page by the end of the term.
