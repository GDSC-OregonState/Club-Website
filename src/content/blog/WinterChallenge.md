This term we wanted to do something a little different. We understand it is difficult to create full on projects given class work, midterms, etc... So this term we decided to host weekly challenges, where you can go as in depth (or not). We will post a new challenges every week, featuring different technologies! The challenge structure is broken down below

## Challenge Breakdown ü§ñ

Each week the challenges are going be structured as follows:

- A Base challenge worth **100 Points**
- Then there will be addition challenges worth between **25-100 points**
- You'll then show your project to us or submit our google form
