Welcome back, Beavers!

This term, the Google Developer Student Club at Oregon State is excited to do Weekly Tech Challenges!

Our goal is simple: create a fun, low-commitment way for you to explore new technologies, build cool projects, and connect with fellow students. Whether you're a coding pro or just starting out, these challenges are for you.

## How It Works

Each week, we will feature a new Google technology in our meeting with a presentation and a hands-on workshop. Here’s what you can expect:

- The 100-Point Challenge: After each workshop, we'll release a core challenge worth 100 points. You can work on it during the meeting with help from your peers and club leads, or complete it on your own time during the week.
- Bonus Challenges: For those who want to dive deeper, we'll offer extra challenges to earn more points and expand your skills even further.
- Prizes, Prizes, Prizes!: We'll be tracking points all term long. We have tons of awesome prizes ready for active members who participate and earn points. The more you learn, the more you can win!

This is the perfect opportunity to add new skills to your résumé and learn about powerful tools and platforms, all without the pressure of a class.

Ready to get started? Join us at our next meeting to kick off the very first challenge! Keep an eye on our announcements for dates, times, and topics.
